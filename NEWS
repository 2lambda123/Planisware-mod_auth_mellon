Version 0.0.7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Renamed the logout endpoint from "logoutRequest" to "logout".
  "logoutRequest" is now an alias for "logout", and may be removed in the
  future.

* Added SP initiated logout. To initiate a logout from the web site, link
  the user to the logout endpoint, with a ReturnTo parameter with the url
  the user should be redirected to after being logged out. Example url:
  "https://www.example.com/secret/endpoint/logout
   ?ReturnTo=http://www.example.com/". (Note that this should be on a
  single line.)

* Fixed a memory leak on login.
